# Parallel-and-Distributed-Systems

Implementation and validation of the Farm stream parallel pattern with concurrency throttling mechanism.
     
![Autonomic farm design. Each node in the
graph corresponds to a single thread of execution. The
archs connecting the nodes define the interaction be-
tween modules. Continues arrows implicitly indicate
send() and receive() operations via channels, and the
archs are labeled with the data transferred. Discontin-
ues arrows are labeled with functions that access the
state of another module. Active and inactive workers
are shown.](./Visualizations/schema.png)
